                I think it is obvious that technology will continue to advance in the future. My interest in coding began in high school. I found a site called CodeAcademy, which offered free classes in learning how to code. 
                In my senior year of high school, I was able to take a computer programming course that covered html, css, and java.
                I am also lucky enough to have an older brother who works with computers and it was inspiring
                to see for me. I took a break from coding for a number of years but I'm back and it feels better than ever!
